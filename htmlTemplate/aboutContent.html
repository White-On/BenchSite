    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

    <h2>What is this tool</h2>
    <p>The benchmark website is a platform designed to compare the performance of different libraries and frameworks. It
        provides a detailed report of each library's speed, precision, and other parameters, making it easier for
        developers to choose the best library for their project.</p>

    <h2>Why Creating this tool</h2>
    <p>The development of this tool was initiated to address the need for a reliable and unbiased way of comparing the
        performance of different libraries. With so many options available in the market, it can be challenging to
        choose the right library for a particular task. This tool aims to simplify the selection process by providing a
        standardized benchmarking methodology for all libraries.</p>

    <h2>How work the tool</h2>
    <p>The benchmark website is designed to automate the process of comparing and testing different libraries. To
        achieve this, the website runs a set of requested tests at the end of each week. The tests are executed in a
        controlled environment, and the results are then analyzed and compiled into easy-to-read reports. These reports
        are published on dedicated GitHub pages, where users can access them and see how the different libraries perform
        in a variety of scenarios. By automating the testing process, the website enables developers to save time and
        effort when evaluating libraries, and helps them make informed decisions based on reliable data.</p>
    
    <h2>How we compare the targets</h2>
    <p>For the time being, we we decided to compare results base on the Lexicographic Maximal Ordering Algorithm (LexMax).
        each ranking is based on the number of wins, ties, and losses of each library. The library with the highest
        number of wins is ranked first, followed by the library with the second-highest number of wins, and so on. In
        the case of a tie, both libraries are ranked equally.
    </p>

    <h2>How to contribute</h2>
    <p>The benchmark website is an open-source project, and contributions from the community are welcome. To contribute,
        users can fork the project on GitHub, make changes to the code, and submit a pull request. Users can also
        contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting improvements, or sharing their benchmarking results. The project has a
        dedicated community of developers who are always willing to help new contributors get started.</p>
